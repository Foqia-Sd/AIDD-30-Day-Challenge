# AIDD-30-Day-Challenge

A 30-day journey of AI-Driven Development (AIDD) tasks, reflections, and exercises to master the AI-Native Era.  
The goal of this repository is to track my learning journey, document insights, and showcase the evolution of human–AI collaboration in software development.  
By completing these tasks, I aim to strengthen my skills as an AI-driven developer and understand the transformative impact of AI in the coding workflow.
